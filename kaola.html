          <h3>KAOLA</h3>
          <p>
            The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes inaccurately called
            the koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to
            Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family
            Phascolarctidae. Its closest living relatives are the wombats. The
            koala is found in coastal areas of the island's eastern and southern
            regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South
            Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and
            large head with round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose. The koala
            has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg
            (8.8–33.1 lb). Its fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate
            brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller
            and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These
            populations are possibly separate subspecies, but not all
            researchers accept this.
