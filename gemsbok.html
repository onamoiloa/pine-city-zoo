          <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
          <p>
            The gemsbok (Oryx gazella), or South African oryx, is a large
            antelope in the genus Oryx. It is endemic to the dry and barren
            regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and (parts of) Zimbabwe,
            mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which it
            is supremely adapted for survival. Previously, some sources
            classified the related East African oryx, or beisa oryx (Oryx
            beisa), as a subspecies.

          <p>
            The name gemsbok is from Afrikaans, which itself is from the Dutch
            word of the same spelling, meaning "male chamois", composed of gems
            (“chamois”) + bok (“buck, male goat”).[4] The Dutch gems is further
            from German Gämse ("chamois").[5] Although some superficial
            similarities in appearance (especially in the facial pattern) are
            noticed, the chamois and the oryx are not closely related. The usual
            pronunciation in English is /ˈɡɛmzbɒk/.[6]
