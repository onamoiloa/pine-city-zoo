          <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
          <p>
            The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
            Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
            ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as
            one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most
            recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant
            species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear
            DNA, and individual species can be distinguished by their fur coat
            patterns. Six valid extinct species of Giraffa from Africa and
            Pakistan are known from the fossil record.
