          <h3>GORILLA</h3>
          <p>
            Gorillas are primarily herbivorous,[1] terrestrial great apes that
            inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla
            is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western
            gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is
            highly similar to that of humans, from 96 to 99% depending on what
            is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to
            humans after the chimpanzees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between
            1.25 and 1.8 m (4 ft 1 in and 5 ft 11 in), weights between 100 and
            270 kg (220 and 600 lb), and arm spans up to 2.6 m (8 ft 6 in),
            depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the
            leader being called a silverback. The eastern gorilla is
            distinguished from the western by darker fur colour and some other
            minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35â€“40 years
            in the wild.
