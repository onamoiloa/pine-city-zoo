          <h3>PANDA</h3>
          <p>
            The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda
            bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is
            characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes,
            ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is rotund; adult individuals
            weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m
            (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. It is sexually dimorphic, with males
            being typically 10 to 20% larger than females. A thumb is visible on
            its forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. It
            has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to meet its
            dietary requirements. It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous
            with a diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo and bamboo shoots.
