          <h3>WARTHONG</h3>
          <p>
            Phacochoerus is a genus in the family Suidae, commonly known as
            warthogs (pronounced wart-hog). They are pigs who live in open and
            semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan
            Africa. The two species were formerly considered conspecific under
            the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is
            limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most
            widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog), is
            Phacochoerus africanus.[2]
