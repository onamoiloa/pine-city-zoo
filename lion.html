          <h3>LION</h3>
          <p>
            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native
            to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested
            body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at
            the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are
            larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social
            species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a
            few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions
            usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large
            ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.
